# Blood Group Identification System

## Overview
The **Blood Group Identification System** is an innovative application that uses deep learning and fingerprint analysis to predict a user's blood group. This non-invasive approach provides a quick and efficient alternative to traditional blood typing methods.

## Features
- **Fingerprint Upload**: Users can upload their fingerprint images for analysis.
- **AI-Powered Analysis**: The system uses a trained deep learning model to analyze fingerprint patterns and predict blood groups.
- **User Authentication**: Secure login and signup functionality for users.
- **Responsive Design**: The application is accessible on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Team and Project Information**: Learn more about the project and the team behind it.

## Technology Stack
- **Frontend**:
  - HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
  - Jinja2 Templates
- **Backend**:
  - Python Flask
  - Flask-Login for user authentication
  - Flask-SQLAlchemy for database management
- **Machine Learning**:
  - TensorFlow for model training and prediction
  - OpenCV for fingerprint image preprocessing
  - NumPy for numerical computations
- **Database**:
  - SQLite (or any SQL database supported by SQLAlchemy)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/blood-group-identification.git
   cd blood-group-identification
   ```

2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
   .\venv\Scripts\activate   # For Windows
   ```

3. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```

5. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```

## Usage
1. **Sign Up**: Create an account to access the system.
2. **Login**: Log in to your account.
3. **Upload Fingerprint**: Navigate to the upload page and upload your fingerprint image.
4. **View Results**: The system will analyze the fingerprint and display the predicted blood group.
